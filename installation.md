# Installation

> Honestly there isn't much to say other than follow the instruction

## [Link to install all arrs](https://wiki.servarr.com/)

- Install the ones you want
- Note
    > Prowlarr and FlareSolverr should be on docker

## [Link to install FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr)

## Downloaing clients
- I use qbittorrent but you can use anything look at [photo](arrAppSetup.md#setup-download-clients)
- qbittorrent has headless webgui package called qbittorrent-nox
``` bash
apt install qbittorrent-nox
```

## Overseerr & Jellyseerr
### Overseerr (Plex only sync)
- I recommend putting this on docker and changing the port. Not sure if it's for everyone but my port 5055 was blocked

### Jellyseerr (Jellyfin & plex)
- I haven't downloaded this so you will have to experience this on your own
